# N.B. - the following magic words (ZORTON through BASINGSTOKE) #must#
# be defined in reverse alphabetical order!  If new magic words
# are added, place them in the proper sequence and modify the
# code in the "AT NOWHERE" area!  If you don't do this right, 
# people are going to have a hell of a time getting out of Nowhere
# during cave-closure. One extra complication... adding magic words
# can make the safe unresponsive to any of the 4 keys in saved
# games, in which the sceptre had been obtained by the player;
# alternatively, if the compatibility kludge in the RESTORE code
# is preserved, it may change the key to BASINGSTOKE (better than nothing, 
# anyway). Only magic words alphabetically lower than BASINGSTOKE are safe.
# Finally, note that the '!' prefixing magic words makes them
# non-abbreviable - the same would work for any other dictionary 
# word too.

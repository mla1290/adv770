This repository contains A-code sources of my Adv770 expansion of Adventure. It is based on my earlier Adv660, which was a merger of two previous expansions: Adv440 by Peter Luskett and Jack Pike, and Adv550 by Dave Platt.
A-code sources can be translated into ANSI C by my A-code to ANSI C translator acdc (https://github.com/mla1290/acdc) and then compiled and linked together with three A-code kernel source files (https://github/mla1290/acode-kernel) using e.g. gcc or clang.
For mor information and a complete A-code bundle, see the A-code section of website: https://mipmip.org/acode/. Various pre-built versions of the game can be found at https://mipmip.org/adv770/.
